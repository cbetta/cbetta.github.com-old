  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> but there are plenty of reasons both monetary and practical not to use it. I always liked the deployment method through Git though.</p>

<p>So this weekend at <a href="http://leedshack.org">LeedsHack</a> I started to look into <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a>, an open source mini-Heroku powered by <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/progrium/buildstep">Buildstep</a> and some other bits that share infrastructure elements with Heroku.</p>

<p>I found the installation rather tedious and as this was a hackathon I decided to create something simpler.</p>

<h2>Introducing Dokkufy</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cbetta/dokkufy">Dokkufy</a> is a Ruby gem that makes it super simple to set up your own mini-Heroku on your own server.</p>

<p>Simply install with a swift <code>gem install dokkufy</code> and you&#8217;re ready to &#8220;dokkufy&#8221; both your server and your app.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Dokkufying your server</h3>

<p>Dokku only works with Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 server, so go get one of those images and boot up a server.</p>

<p>Then on your local machine run:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/995577526584091c1e31.js"></script>


<p>As you can see this will ask you for a few details: server name or IP, username, and the eventual server domain to run all apps under. After a few minutes, depending on your broadband speeds, you will have a Dokku server ready do go.</p>

<p>Open up your server&#8217;s domain or IP in a browser and voila!</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2014/nginx.png" alt="Nginx" /></p>

<h3>Part 2a: Dokkufying your app</h3>

<p>Now that we have a Dokku server ready to go it&#8217;s time to prepare your app.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample">Heroku Node JS sample app</a> for my example.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/50149a1b60d47ba91f28.js"></script>


<p>As you can see this simply asks for the details of your server and then adds a Git remote and writes a <code>.dokkurc</code> file to your app.</p>

<p>Now do a <code>git push dokku master</code> and you will see your app deployed.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/f5379254e1563f00c7ae.js"></script>


<p>Dokku will automatically create your project for you on first push and deploy your app to a subdomain of your chosen domain. In this case we deployed our app to <a href="http://node-js-sample.ppd.io">http://node-js-sample.ppd.io</a>.</p>

<h3>Part 2b: Controlling Dokku</h3>

<p>When you install Dokku on your server it gives you some handy commands. Sadly to run those from your local machine you need to perform some ssh-fu.</p>

<p>So to make this easier Dokkufy also comes with a local <code>dokku</code> command. You can use this command in any dokkufied app that has a <code>.dokkurc</code> file. It will automatically use that file to infer the remote server details and your app name.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/b1ffe8aca4f571fbbd21.js"></script>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Some final notes</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s it for Dokkufy. I recommend running <code>dokkufy help</code> to see how you can explore and install plugins to install things like Postgres, Redis, and other features on your machine.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the awesome <a href="https://github.com/progrium">Jeff Lindsay</a> for his work on Dokku and I want to highlight what seems to be the next iteration of Dokku: <a href="https://flynn.io/">Flynn</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3><a href="http://github.com/ukiepc2013">UK IEPC 2013</a></h3>

<p>I decided to drop by the <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~mlw/ukiepc/2013/">UKIEPC</a> at Nottingham University today and they offered me to enter as a visitor. I used to do these programming competitions when I was in uni with Melinda and Reinier (go Team OLF!) so it was a bit of nostalgia to be able to participate again. I ended up leading the board for a bit in Nottingham but eventually <a href="https://ukiepc13.contest.scrool.se/standings/">ended up 2nd, and 22nd on the UK standings</a>. Only downside: Ruby wasn&#8217;t an allowed language so I had to brush up my Python skills.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.petekeen.net/dry-your-rails-crud-with-simple-form-and-inherited-resources">DRY up your CRUD</a></h3>

<p>I really love the idea of the <a href="https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources">Inherited Resources</a> gem in this article to clean up standard CRUD code. I&#8217;m tempted to try this in a project I&#8217;m working on at the moment in combination with <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">cancan</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://12factor.net/">The Twelve Factor App</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been starting to get the hang of app deployment lately. I have access to the internal <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> platform at eBay and have written a few modules to handle deployment for my Rails apps. I keep going back to this site to challenge myself to answer the question: what would be the right way to do this?</p>

<h3><a href="http://gistflow.com/posts/901-sandi_meter-tool-for-checking-sandi-metz-rules">sandi_meter gem</a></h3>

<p>Apparently Sandi Metz recently talked about her seemingly arbitrary but pretty sensible standards for maintaining clean, manageable and readable code. It&#8217;s one of those basic heuristics that helps you identify code smell. It has now been turned into a gem by Anatoli Makarevich and will join my list of handy code sanitation tools.</p>

<h3><a href="https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free">Switch to HTTPS for free</a></h3>

<p>Getting an SSL certificate can be expensive but apparently using <a href="https://www.startssl.com/">StartSSL</a> you can now get your own for free for personal use. Sadly <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> doesn&#8217;t support SSL so I won&#8217;t be switching this site any day soon, but I will keep it in mind if I ever change hosting.</p>

<h3><a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a></h3>

<p>I am not a great fan of Twitter Bootstrap. It somehow seems to breed divs and everything made in it looks like Twitter Bootstrap. This framework looks to be a bit cleaner and I like the look. Now don&#8217;t all go use it or I will get sick of this one pretty quickly too.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/news/20130924.html">ruby-lang.org design contest</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve never really liked the Ruby website (<a href="http://rubylang.org">ruby-lang.org</a>) so it is good to see a competition to find a new design. I&#8217;m not sure about the whole free labour implications in this but I think there are plenty of passionate Ruby devs wiling to put in an entry just to give back to the community.</p>

<time datetime="2013-09-27T08:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 27<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this year PayPal launched the new <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/log-in-with-paypal/">Log In with PayPal</a> experience worldwide. Integrating it into Rails is very straightforward with the help of <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">Omniauth</a> so I thought I&#8217;d show how with a little tutorial.</p>

<p><strong>Log In With PayPal</strong> is much like <strong>Log In with Twitter</strong> or <strong>Log In with Facebook</strong> but it has the cool benefit of being able to provide you some extra user information like:</p>

<ul>
<li>A full street address</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Account verification status</li>
</ul>


<p>All the code for this tutorial is available on <a href="https://github.com/cbetta/login-with-paypal-demo-rails">Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Acquiring credentials</h2>

<p><strong>Log In With PayPal</strong> uses OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect 1.0 and the full documentation can be found on the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">PayPal developer portal</a>. Because it&#8217;s based on OAuth 2.0 we&#8217;re going to have to get some OAuth credentials that we can use in our app.</p>

<h3>Creating an application profile</h3>

<p>The developer portal doubles as the sandbox and application control panel. Head over and login to get yourself some fresh credentials.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://developer.paypal.com">developer.paypal.com</a></li>
<li>Login or signup and then login</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/applications/myapps">Applications</a></li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Create application</strong> button</li>
<li>Choose a name, leave the <strong>Integration type</strong> set to <strong>Web</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Your app is now created and you can find your credentials under <strong>Application Details</strong>. Please note that there are 2 sets of credentials. Your live credentials can be used for actual payments and actual logins with real PayPal accounts. Your test credentials are there for using <strong>sandbox accounts</strong> (read fake/mock accounts) when in development.</p>

<h3>Enabling Log In With PayPal</h3>

<p>We are going to have to enable Log In With PayPal for our app.</p>

<ol>
<li>Scroll down to the bottom of your app details</li>
<li>Flip the switch to turn <strong>Log In With PayPal</strong> to <strong>ON</strong></li>
<li>Set the <strong>Return URL</strong> to <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/paypal/callback</code> (or something else if you don&#8217;t run your Rails app like this)</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Add a different return URL for test</strong> and also set that return URL.</li>
<li>Set the privacy policy and agreement URLs to anything you want for now</li>
<li>Scroll a bit back up and hit <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Optionally you can now toggle <strong>Accept Payments</strong> to off if you don&#8217;t intend to take payments with this app.</p>

<h3>Test accounts</h3>

<p>If you want to run Log In With PayPal in sandbox (a.k.a. test) mode you will need to create some fake test accounts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">developer.paypal.com</a> and login</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/applications/myapps">Applications</a></li>
<li>On the left click on <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/applications/accounts">Sandbox accounts</a></li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Create Account</strong> button</li>
<li>Unless you have any specific needs I advice you only fill in the following:

<ol>
<li>Fill in an <strong>email address</strong>. It has to be unique and not match any other live or sandbox email address. I generally pick one of my domains and do <strong>something@mydomain.com</strong>.</li>
<li>Fill in a <strong>password</strong>. Pick something easy.</li>
<li>Skip everything else and hit <strong>Create Account</strong> at the bottom of the page</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Using sandbox account for Log In With PayPal is very useful as it allows you to login as different users. At no point should you be sharing your live PayPal username and password with other developers for testing.</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>

<p>Assuming a plain Rails app adding Log In With PayPal is now pretty straightforward.</p>

<h3>Add omniauth</h3>

<p>Add the omniauth gem to your <code>Gemfile</code> and bundle.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/8b49e385cac9ad2aeb63.js"></script>


<p>Now add the following snippet into <code>config/initializers/omniauth.rb</code>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/294896cd54c795b6e52c.js"></script>


<p>Replace the <code>"AZj...yjx"</code> and <code>"EL4...Q3s"</code> with own API Client ID and Secret respectively. Also make sure to set the sandbox value to <code>false</code> when using your Live API credentials.</p>

<h3>Handle login</h3>

<p>Now that your app is setup and running visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/paypal</code> to start the login. Go try it and use that test account you just set up!</p>

<p>You may notice that after the login the app will return back to your app on the <code>/auth/paypal/callback</code> path and then fail. This is because we still need to implement this functionality.</p>

<p>We need to do 2 things. First we add a catch for this route in <code>config/routes.rb</code>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/bde3d873ba1be5d826fc.js"></script>


<p>We then need to implement this action in <code>app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb</code> much like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/b6b69d4fa07d5be6273f.js"></script>


<p>The magic here is in the <code>request.env['omniauth.auth']</code> object, which is generated by Omniauth and will look something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/d8870bcb0736ca6d143f.js"></script>


<p>You can use the <code>uid</code> to identify the user. I used it to find or create a <code>User</code> record, but you could also tie it to a different model. In my case I can then use the following to find the user:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/fe53c8eaf482b4331bf1.js"></script>


<h2>Advanced</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Most of my code can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/cbetta/login-with-paypal-demo-rails">Github</a> and it includes a full login and logout. I want to highlight a few extra things though that are available to you that are pretty useful.</p>

<h3>More user details</h3>

<p>Getting the user&#8217;s UID is fun but rather limiting. Luckily Log In With PayPal allows for a whole lot of <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/log-in-with-paypal/detailed/#attributes">extra attributes</a> to be requested. By default you have access to all attributes in the <code>openid</code> <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/log-in-with-paypal/detailed/#attributes">scope</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s change our code to also request the user&#8217;s <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email address</strong>. If we look at the table we see that for this we need to add the <code>email</code> and <code>profile</code> scopes to our Omniauth configuration.</p>

<p>The first step is to add these scopes to Omniauth:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/5721d05a6d0432fce50c.js"></script>


<p>Please make sure <strong>not to comma seperate the scopes</strong> as this will cause issues later.</p>

<p>Secondly we need to update our application settings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go back to our application details on <a href="http://developer.paypal.com">developer.paypal.com</a></li>
<li>Scroll to the <strong>Log In With PayPal</strong> settings at the bottom</li>
<li>Click <strong>Customize</strong> next to <strong>Personal Information</strong> and tick <strong>Full name</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Customize</strong> next to <strong>Address Information</strong> and tick <strong>Email address</strong></li>
<li>Scroll up a bit and save</li>
</ol>


<p>Now if we try to login again we can access the user&#8217;s extra details as follows:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/a0a1f2894d98b312cfbc.js"></script>


<h3>Omniauth test mode</h3>

<p>Omniauth can be slow and especially in tests this can be frustrating. Luckily Omniauth has a <strong>test mode</strong> that allows you to skip the PayPal flow and just &#8220;pretend&#8221; like a user has logged in.</p>

<p>Add the following to your <code>config/initializes/omniauth.rb</code>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/fbda182d6cdd5f1295e3.js"></script>


<p>Your app will now skip the PayPal servers and login with the details from above. I use this a lot in my automatic tests.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now but I will soon be doing a few more of these. I&#8217;m planning at least an overview of how to do this in Sinatra and I also want to demo how to use <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/log-in-with-paypal/detailed/#seamlesscheckout">Seamless Checkout</a> on top of this tutorial.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I&#8217;d get back into blogging again so let&#8217;s start with a simple reading list. Here&#8217;s some articles that have kept me busy over the past week and I&#8217;d think people ight enjoy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pete Keen has a short list of <a href="http://www.petekeen.net/essential-tools-for-starting-a-rails-app-in-2013">Essential Tools for Starting a Rails App in 2013</a>. I knew most of them but there were a few I didn&#8217;t yet.</li>
<li>Lindsey Bieda has a nice article explaining how to add a <a href="http://rarlindseysmash.com/posts/config-and-generators-in-gems">nice configuration method and generator</a> to your Ruby Gem. I need to add this to my next Gem.</li>
<li>The great guys at GlobalDev are doing a series of RubyTips. As a big proponent for short, concise and well structured code I think there&#8217;s a few amazing gems (no pun intended) in there. (<a href="http://globaldev.co.uk/2013/09/ruby-tips-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://globaldev.co.uk/2013/09/ruby-tips-part-2/">Part 2</a>)</li>
<li>My colleague Tim has been working on a series explaining how to use the new REST APIs in NodeJS. The firs 2 parts are available now (<a href="https://devblog.paypal.com/building-a-node-and-paypal-app/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://devblog.paypal.com/building-a-web-app-with-node-js-the-paypal-sdk-part-2/">Part 2</a>). I need to do this myself to get the hang of NodeJS a bit more.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been tempted to write a bit about Static Site Generators (SSGs) for a while now, mainly because I love them. I&#8217;ve been using (Jekyll)[http://jekyllrb.com/] for various projects for a while now and I love it. The simplified hosting, higher security, and general hackability are just a few pros that make it worth it.</p>

<p>But they have also pained me, and after reading <a href="http://screamingatmyscreen.com/2013/8/the-joy-and-pain-of-using-a-static-site-generator-for-private-and-client-work/">&#8220;The joy and pain of using a static site generator for private and client work&#8221;</a> I thought I&#8217;d add in my own few observations from a Jekyll perspective.</p>

<h2>The joys</h2>

<p>Why would I talk about Jekyll specifically? It has a lot of pros that make it
one of the most popular SSGs out there, and hence worth dicussing. Here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s extremely simple, has no predefined structure, just write HTML or Markdown and go</li>
<li>No server side code is a big pro to me, easier deployment, easier security, simpler hosting.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the default recommended SSG for <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, allowing you to use them as free hosting!</li>
<li>Github even compiles Jekyll for you server side meaning you can use <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> to edit your site.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pain points</h2>

<p>Sadly not all is perfect and here are some of my main observations of working on a few Jekyll sites in small teams.</p>

<h3>Forget about I18n</h3>

<p>Most of you might not ever need any internationalisation but the day a client turns around to you and asks &#8220;Can we translate this one page to Spanish?&#8221; you will hate yourself for using Jekyll. Internationalisation is not standard supported and therefore a royal pain in the *** to do nice.</p>

<p>Not to mention that you can&#8217;t serve the same content in different languages under the same URL depending on the user&#8217;s cookie or locale. Forget about it, ain&#8217;t gonna happen.</p>

<h3>No plugins on Github</h3>

<p>There are a lot of plugins for Jekyll and they&#8217;re awesome. There&#8217;s even a few for I18n, though I never tried them. Sadly non of them are supported by Github. Sure, you can compile your code client side, then push the compiled code (including the plugin generated code) to the server. This stops you from quickly pushing any mayor changes without using a laptop.</p>

<h3>No predefined structure</h3>

<p>Jekyll is ridiculously simple. I think all you need is a config file and some HTML or Markdown and <strong>boom</strong> your site is there.  But when your site extends beyond a few files you quickly start adding some folders: images go into <code>/images/</code>, stylesheets into <code>/stylesheets/</code>, etc. But what about pages? Use <code>foo.html</code> or <code>foo/index.html</code>? Store the images for that pages in <code>/images/foo/</code> or <code>/foo/images/</code>?</p>

<p>All of these decisions are easily made, but it does mean you need to explain every new decision to your colleagues, and it increases the technical debt when bringing onboard new developers.</p>

<h3>Markdown is limited</h3>

<p>I love Markdown but sometimes it can be such a pain. Especially when you want to go outside of the standard &#8220;headers, paragraphs, links&#8221; it can just be upsetting. Getting HTML inside Markdown to work in Jekyll used to (and probably still) require switching to a different Markdown parser, which wasn&#8217;t supported on Github, etc.</p>

<p>To be honest this is a bit of a pet peeve with Markdown, not Jekyll. Often all I want to do is just add a class to something, either a header or a link. I often wished Markdown supported something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cbetta/48c07f2bd1e1915aefa6.js"></script>


<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<p>In short, I think a few suggestions for the further improvements of Jekyll, Github Pages, and Markdown are at hand:</p>

<ol>
<li>Standard I18n support in Jekyll would be nice</li>
<li>Support for some default &#8220;safe&#8221; plugins on Github would be amazing</li>
<li>A generator to generate a &#8220;default&#8221; site structure would be nice and could help promote best practices.</li>
<li>Markdown should support some basic classes and indexes, allowing easier application of CSS and JS.</li>
</ol>


<p>Alternatively I highly recommend using <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, another SSG that seems to solve some of the pain points described above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the problems I keep running into with Puppet is that the packages I&#8217;m trying to install are very new and I need to run <code>apt-get update</code> to update the repositories. Because Puppet does not run scripts it gets rather annoying to get the update to run before you install any packages.</p>

<p>I found a lot of solutions around the web but this one seems to work best for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the light of the recent <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems.org</a> security compromise the community has been looking at ways to make Rubygems.org and Ruby gems in general more secure. The project is still ongoing and feel free to help them out on #rubygems on Freenode, but here is a highlight of what I think are some of the main issues.</p>

<p>Some of the issues highlighted here are taken from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-5bO0Q1J9s">Ben Smith&#8217;s enlightening (but scary) talk at Aloha Ruby Conference</a>.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I am not a security expert. I am just a Ruby developer and a gem author that is worried about the current state of the Ruby gems ecosystem. I also am worried that the next negative news around Ruby will involve the problems described below.</p>

<h2>What are Ruby gems and what is Rubygems.org?</h2>

<p>For those not familiar, <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems.org</a> is the most popular repository of &#8220;gems&#8221; for the <a href="http://rubylang.org">Ruby language</a>. Gems are libraries made up out of Ruby (and optionally C) code and can be uploaded by anyone who registered for an account. Rubygems.org currently hosts 50,685 gems which have been downloaded 1,259,533,358 times since July 2009. Ruby gems are not only hosted on Rubygems.org, anyone can run their own repository but Rubygems.org is definitely the most used one.</p>

<h2>Current state</h2>

<p>Some parts of the current infrastructure are worrying.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hard to tell if gems were changed on the repo.</strong> It took the Rubygems.org volunteers more than 24 hours to verify every gem&#8217;s checksum against external mirrors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impossible to tell if gems were uploaded by gem owner.</strong> It is currently very hard to know if a gem was actually uploaded by it&#8217;s owner. Developer machines can be compromised and a users API credentials for Rubygems.org are kept unencrypted in <code>~/gem/credentials</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gem owner isn&#8217;t notified of new gem uploads.</strong> When a gem developer&#8217;s credentials are compromised a new version of the gem can be uploaded without the gem owner ever knowing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impossible to notify a gem user of compromised gems.</strong> When a gem developer&#8217;s credentials are compromised it is hard to notify anyone who uses any of the gems published by the developer of the situation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gems can run code on install.</strong> This is probably the most interesting attack vector in the foreseeable future. It seems this feature was relatively unintentional as it involves tying into the fact that Ruby gems can contain C code. Running code on install will mean that gems can steal the unencrypted Rubygems.org credentials which can then be used to modify the compromised user&#8217;s gems and spread the malicious code further.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Proposals for change</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Notify gem owners of newly published gems.</strong> Adding a simple email notification to the gem owner will at least allow for easier detection of compromised gems. Sadly at this point the gem is already compromised and possibly already spread over any mirrors and downloaded by users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure developer&#8217;s Rubygems.org credentials.</strong> This is pretty simple. My ssh key has a passphrase on it and so should my Rubygems.org credentials. Stealing a rubygems.org API key is easy, using one that requires a passphrase a lot harder.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop running code on gem install.</strong> I totally see the need for having C extensions in a Ruby gems, and those extensions need to be compiled, but we seriously need to find a way to compile C code without allowing for the arbitrary execution of code on install of a gem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatically mirror gems and checksums.</strong>  A system involving the automatic mirroring of gems and their checksums to other servers would definitely have made the verification of gems a lot easier in the last few days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Force signing of gems.</strong> Yes, <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/21">you can sign your gems</a> but almost nobody does (and neither do I). Additionally it&#8217;s a pain to force the usage of signed keys on the gem user&#8217;s side, not to mention the futility as most gems aren&#8217;t signed. Signing is the way to go though and work on this has started. It&#8217;s a difficult topic though and work is being done to make it as painless as possible for users and developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notify gem users of unsigned/insecure gems.</strong> The rubygem binary (together with tools like <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>) should be updated to allow for verification of signatures which will allow it to notify gem users of unsigned or compromised gems.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>How can I help?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/rubygems">rubygems</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems-trust">rubygems-trust</a>(fork for implementing a signed approach)</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> #rubygems and #rubygems-trust on Freenode</li>
</ul>


<h2>Did I miss anything?</h2>

<p>Please let me know and I&#8217;ll add it to the list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With all the new years resolutions out of the way I want to share what (programming) skills I learned or revisited in 2012.</p>

<p>This will be more positive than looking back in a year and counting the things I promised but didn&#8217;t do.</p>

<h2>Programming skills</h2>

<h4>Advanced Ruby</h4>

<p>I knew Ruby already, but it always was a very &#8220;Rails&#8221; type of Ruby. Working with <a href="http://caius.name/">Caius</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rahoulbaruah">Baz</a> at <a href="http://emberads.com">EmberAds</a> has brought this to a whole new level though. Writing modules, writing gems, extending classes, applying best practices, etc, all of those can seem daunting at first but they are oh so useful.</p>

<p>It also has had a great effect on my proficiency in Rails.</p>

<blockquote><p>You can spot a good Rails programmer by their number of regular Ruby objects in their codebase</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember who said this but it really has started to ring truth to me in the past year. The Rails community has lately been alight with discussions about DCI, Concerns, Service Objects, Delegation and other ways of moving more and more code out of controller and models and into regular Ruby objects.</p>

<h4>Testing code using RSpec</h4>

<p>Learning to write tests has always been at the top of my list of things to learn but I somehow never got to it. Luckily Caius and Baz wouldn&#8217;t allow any code to go untested and it soon became a much loved practice. It is a hard skill to master though so I don&#8217;t blame my past self.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a skill best learned by example and from a colleague. I still feel like I&#8217;m learning more and more about the intricate aspects though as it&#8217;s relatively easy to write a test that tests too much or too little. We&#8217;ll see where I am at the end of 2013.</p>
