I appreciate a good responsive site design. The idea of developing mobile first and then scaling elements up as a user's screen size increases makes perfect sense to me. To me this is part of a good progressive enhancement methodology.

Lately I've seen a nasty trend though where sites infinitely scale to show the same content on-screen regardless of the user's screen size.
