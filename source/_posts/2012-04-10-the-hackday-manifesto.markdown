One of my friends, [Dan](http://artisanofcode.com/), started a document called ["The Hack Day Manifesto"](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/) on the #GeeksOfLondon IRC channel a few days back. With the help of our community we managed to update it to a full document and it's now live.

It's a must read if you ever plan to run a hack day or hackathon.

It's already signed by quite a few hackday organisers including the GeeksOfLondon team and you can add your own name by simply [forking](https://github.com/hackdaymanifesto/hackdaymanifesto.github.com/), adding your name, and making a pull request.
