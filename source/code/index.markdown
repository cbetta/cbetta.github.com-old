A selection of my projects that I created, either for work, for hack days, or for personal interest.

More of my code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cbetta).

## PayPal Wishlist (work)

[Website](https://paypal.com/)

The PayPal Wishlist web app was a marketing project by PayPal UK and PayPal NL, allowing anyone to specify their Christmas wish list and possibly win it entirely. Working with PayPal was a pleasure and dealing with the amazing amount of interest they generated, and the accompanied scaling issues, was extremely interesting.
